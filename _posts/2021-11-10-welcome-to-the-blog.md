 It almost feels strange creating a blog in 2021. Growing up my sister was very big into blogging, there was a pretty big scene around fashion and makeup but these days blogspot seems like a relic of the past. I tried my hand at it once or twice myself, though I never had much to actually talk about or show so I found it difficult to keep the motivation. These days it's a different story for me. I have a plethora of interests, many of which I hope to be able to tell you more about as I write more! 

 In that sense, I feel the language of our generation is vastly different than it was even a few years ago. We share our interests, our lives through photos and social media posts. And that's it. Most of the blogs I see from people around my age are programming/engineering blogs used to promote oneself for careers, or niche circles. But maybe that's why I'm so attracted to the idea of blogging. I'm only expecting this site to be seen by people I know, or people from the fediverse. A lot of my posts about topics like the fediverse and other cool internet things will assume you might not be familiar with them, fair warning if you are however!

  One of the biggest things for me right now is a sort of transition of ideas. I'm growing up into a world I don't particularly like, you could name any problem you like: the climate crisis, multi-billionares (or any problem the rich elite are behind) or the housing crisis. It's clear our future is becoming a hostile place, and all of this is a weight on the shoulder of many in our generation. I'll leave my thoughts for future posts, but it's something I'm very keen to touch on, how we can change this with technology but also how it can be expressed in art and photography.

   So welcome to the blog! I hope this post has gotten you interested, I'll try keep a consistant stream of posts but I'll never promise anything!
